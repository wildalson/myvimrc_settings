# myvimrc_settings

PLUGINS:
 Note: You might need to install these plugins before you want to use my .vimrc settings, since I've mapped some commands.		
	1. Pathogen - for simple and easy plugin installation, also used for managing runtime path.
	2. NERDTree - used for file nagivation
	3. CtrlP - search and open multiple files
