# myvimrc_settings

PLUGINS:
 Note: You might need to install these plugins before you want to use my .vimrc settings, since I've mapped some commands. <br/>		
<p>1. Pathogen - for simple and easy plugin installation, also used for managing runtime path.</p>
<p>2. NERDTree - used for file nagivation</p>
<p>3. CtrlP - search and open multiple files</p>
